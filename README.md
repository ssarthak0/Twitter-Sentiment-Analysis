Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using the Naive Bayes algorithm and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on their content.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the SemEval-2017 Task 4 dataset, which contains tweets labeled with sentiment scores. The dataset covers a wide range of topics and includes tweets with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning: Removed special characters, URLs, mentions, and hashtags.
Normalization: Lowercased all text and applied stemming or lemmatization.
Feature extraction: Converted text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
Model Training:

Implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment classification.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Tuned hyperparameters and optimized model performance.
Evaluation:

Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
Achieved an accuracy of 80% on the SemEval-2017 Task 4 dataset.
Usage
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, etc.
